categorize peaks into 4 categories, kind of like filters
1) Shared with all others
2) Shared with either vehicle (OR)
3) for file X
	a) shared between treatments (eg. peak in IR that is in any of gh2ax)
	b) shared with same treatment different target (eg. peak in IR-LDHA that is in IR-gh2ax)
	c) same treatment $ !different treatment (singleton, peak in IR-LDHA but NOT in IR-h2ax)

Sum these categories up and you should have #peaks
